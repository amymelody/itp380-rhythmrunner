Rhythm Runner is the final game we created for USC's ITP380 Video Game Programming class. It is a unique rhythm game tasking players to stay on the beat by navigating a ship through notes, or using their fingers to dance on a numpad.

I worked on most of the game mechanics (scoring, abilities, hitting beats, accuracy, health, win/lose states) as well as population of the beatmap by parsing a .txt file. The game was written in C# using Visual Studio 2010 and XNA game studio.

The game comes with high score and song editor features, packaged in a retro, low-fi graphics gaming experience.
